# #II. Using different data types
# number = 7
# print(f"The number is {number}.")

# #III. Operators and Different Data Types
# color = 'blue'
# animal = 'horse'
# print(color + animal)
# print(color + ' ' + animal + '!')
# combined_words = color + ' ' + animal + ' '
# print(combined_words)

# #III part II
# boys_count = 10
# girls_count = 12
# print(boys_count + girls_count)
# total_count = boys_count + girls_count
# print(total_count)

# #IV. Mixing strings and numbers
# apple_count = 5
# print("You have " + apple_count + " apples") #ERROR!

# #IV part II
# length_num = 50
# width_num = 10
# print(length_num + width_num)
# length_string = str(length_num)
# width_string = str(width_num)
# print(length_string + width_string)

# #IV part III
# quantity_from_user = input("How many items do you have? ")
# quantity_number = int(quantity_from_user)
# double_number = quantity_number * 2

#     #WRONG:
# print("Twice as many is: " + double_number)
#     #Right:
# double_string = str(double_number)
# print("Twice as many is: " + double_string)
# print("Twice as many is " + str(double_number))

# #IV part IV
#     #Using two lines
# people_string = input("How many people are in the room? ")
# people_number = int(people_string)

#     #Using one line
# people_number = int(input("How many people are in the room? "))

#     #The same works for folating point numbers:
# length_number = float(input("What is the length? "))

# #V. Expressions and Mathmatical Operations
#     #Add is +
# print(3 + 4)
#     #Subtract is -
# print(3 - 4)
#     #Multiply is *
# print(3 * 4)
#     #Divide is /
# print(15 / 4)
#     #Divide and drop remainder is //
# print(15 // 4)
#     #Remainder or Modulus is %
# print(25 % 7)
#     #Exponent(to the power of) is **
# print(3 ** 4)
